Generate the following two result sets:
Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). 
For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).

Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.

Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies. Each of the companies follows this hierarchy: 
Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, 
total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.
Note:
The tables may contain duplicate records.
The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, 
then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.
Input Format
The following tables contain company data:
Company: The company_code is the code of the company and founder is the founder of the company. 
Lead_Manager: The lead_manager_code is the code of the lead manager, and the company_code is the code of the working company. 
Senior_Manager: The senior_manager_code is the code of the senior manager, the lead_manager_code is the code of its lead manager, 
and the company_code is the code of the working company. 
Manager: The manager_code is the code of the manager, the senior_manager_code is the code of its senior manager, 
the lead_manager_code is the code of its lead manager, and the company_code is the code of the working company. 
Employee: The employee_code is the code of the employee, the manager_code is the code of its manager, 
the senior_manager_code is the code of its senior manager, the lead_manager_code is the code of its lead manager, 
and the company_code is the code of the working company.
